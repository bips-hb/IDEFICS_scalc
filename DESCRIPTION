Description: Provides tools to compute standardized percentiles and z-scores for anthropometric
    and metabolic parameters in children, based on age-, sex-, and height-specific reference data
    from the IDEFICS study. Supports computation of a composite Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) score
    and associated action levels for child health monitoring.
